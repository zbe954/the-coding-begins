 ## Project: CSS Website

### Introduction:
This project is a static website built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website that showcases various elements of CSS, including typography, layout, colors, and images. The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - The website consists of several HTML files, each representing a different page or section of the website. The main HTML file, `index.html`, serves as the entry point and includes the header, navigation menu, main content, and footer.
   - Each HTML file is well-structured with proper headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize the content effectively.

2. **CSS Styles**:
   - The website's visual appearance is defined using CSS stylesheets. The main CSS file, `style.css`, contains the global styles that apply to the entire website.
   - CSS is used to control the layout, typography, colors, and other visual elements of the website. It ensures consistency and uniformity throughout the website.

3. **Header and Navigation**:
   - The header section includes the website's logo and the main navigation menu.
   - The navigation menu is created using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and styled with CSS to display horizontal menu items.

4. **Main Content**:
   - The main content area is where the primary information and content of each page are displayed.
   - It includes sections such as "About Us," "Services," "Portfolio," and "Contact Us."

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The website is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts its layout and content to different screen sizes.
   - Media queries are used to adjust the layout, font sizes, and other elements based on the device's viewport width.

6. **Images and Icons**:
   - Images and icons are used throughout the website to enhance the visual appeal and provide additional information.
   - The images are optimized for web use, and their sizes are adjusted using CSS to ensure proper display on different devices.

7. **Footer**:
   - The footer section appears at the bottom of each page and typically includes copyright information and contact details.
